### Google Reviews WordPress Plugin

Many successful businesses use WordPress plugins to show off rave reviews left by customers, in the hope that it persuades other consumers to give them a shot. Unless you’re not interested in free marketing, displaying Google reviews for your business is a no-brainer.

Google reviews, in particular, have a significant influence on consumer purchase decisions, given the massive popularity of the search engine and the number of people with Google accounts. Many consumers claim that Google is the first place they go to assess a business based on reviews, which makes Google reviews more reliable than those from other websites.

You can leverage Google to catapult your business to further success if you try to secure as many four and five-star reviews as possible. The more reviews you have, the more prominent your business will become in a Google search, meaning more consumers will consider using your services.

If you don’t yet have any Google reviews, there’s no need to panic; simply start requesting of your existing customers that they leave one when they get a chance. Get into the habit of soliciting reviews through email and SMS since by making it a regular practice you increase your chances of getting more of them.
